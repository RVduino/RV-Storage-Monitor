# RV-Storage-Monitor
Measure Coach and Chassis battery status as well as temp and humidity data from inside your coach while it's in storage. This will require there be a wifi signal present in the coach. Data will be collected by an ESP-01 chip sending to a free cloud IOT service (AskSensors) for storage and visualization.
